# Inspiration ❤️

This app is made to have a over look on a particular organisations tweeter page and to find what do people think of this organisation and should we invest in it or not.

# Introduction ⚒  

Write your organisation's name with '@' before it so that our twitter API can parse through the tweets which contain '@(Comapnies)' name only.Then using a ML model the 
app would identify wether the following tweet is positive , negative or zero.
